TILT SENSOR:
- Java 

DESCRIPTION:
- A tilt sensor used during the 2012 University Rover Challenge's winning rover team YURT (York university Team)
- Part of a HUD Graphical user interface for the driver 
- Only meant to demonstrate the workings of the tiltsensor, the dependencies are there for testing and simulation. (the tilt sensor is the final version but the other two files are not)
- I coded this during first year university, at the time I was unable to find any coded examples of TiltSensors, so take from this what you will, but dont judge the style / lack of comments. I've grown.
